This is a list of flaws discovered by people - Savvy
---
~lorp
'vote' command - 'abort' does not show in syntax/help msg
>resolved in g_cmds.c, Cmd_vote_f()
~lorp
C4 arming does not cause 'respawn' command from working
>resolved in c4.c C4_Arm()
~savvy
currently in grim's gloom and normal r1 dlls: drone is completely nerfed, sts shouldn't have resistance to fire, gas is understandable with gas mask, but NO FUCKING FIRE PROTECTION; stingers require more health, better slash, better autoslash, and better fire; c4 needs to be fixed to STOP at walls, eg. objects instead of crazy arsed effects that go through walls; grenade power needs reduction on classes, slightly less on spikers; spikers suck with all settings, humans can always get by 'em; mg turrets and turrets are too fucking fast reacting for SMALL aliens for aliens to ever get to the campers, LARGE aliens should get shot at more, as they are a 'bigger threat' to the turrets (check bbox sizes and prioritize?)
>
~savvy
alien slash does NOT work anymore, it's like you can't hit shit; maybe this is ping-based? make slash prediction, eg. find ents within a radius IN FRONT OF the alien, and slash towards in, maybe a 4 sided pyramid with the top cut off for prediction zone in front of alien (4 lines using opposite "slopes" ?)
~savvy / tachikoma / edo / zorg
maplist flaw; repeats maps almost every other map sometimes
>grim gloom only i think
~savvy
target_healer and target_repair_bay, whatever it is... does not work for upgrades
>tried to resolve, can upgrade anywhere atm for some odd reason
~bloodsucker
upgraded kami corpses do not spew spikes
>fix via upgrade check? (is client cleared and corpse generated on death???)
~savvy | DONE - resolved i hope, MAKE SURE TO UPDATE WEAPON INDEXES NEXT TIME
+ for some odd reason, once (only once), i made my (commando? (might be xt, first proxy mine build)) throw grenades etc, do stuff... went to get more
and GOT SPIKE SPORES INSTEAD OF FRAG GRENADES - SAME NUMBER OF GRENADES
+ cannot use medpacks under most circumstances
+ stalker cannot use spike spores??
possible solution: the addition of the proxy mine fucked the precache indexes up (for ITEM_INDEX and FindItem())
>was the precache indexes alright, fixed by moving to bottom and adding cache indexes (even if not used) for mines
~savvy
longer slash ranges, current ones SUCK
~savvy
hatchling and drone jumps are always going right over humans, unless you decide to slow yourself in mid air or jump too earily...
entity gravity override float value would work very nicely

---
this is a list of ideas to add / consider
---
~savvy
drone Mucus Glands upgrade adds to maximum spit total - 8 or 10
~savvy | DONE
enhanced damage for hatchling upgrade should also increase max_health and add difference between normal hp and new max health (int oldmax = ent->s.max_health; ent->s.max_health *= 2; ent->s.health += (ent->s.max_health - oldmax);)
~savvy
split vote mutes to the following: teammute (team mute, cannot use teamchat), publicmute (public chat mute, cannot use public chat), votemute (cannot start votes, but can vote), globalmute (cannot do any (this is old mute))
~savvy
wraith upgrade for 2-4 frags for spike bomb dropping, eg. spike shower (+use), upgrades from ACID TO SPIKE SHOWER, so that you cannot use acid anymore, ramp shots up like grim's thing, but like 5 max per ramp, and pretty fast at it
wraith upgrade for 1 frag for healing teammates/structures with spit
~edo | DONE
increase wraith spit
1) range
2) velocity (speed)
(dll ref: 2004-1-1)
~savvy
breeder single poke can heal alien structures; called "healing touch" or "evolution acceleration" :)
~savvy
guided rockets from holding +use as ht?
basically an ht holds +use for x number of server frames / length of time
player becomes flying without speed control (+forward), at rocket speed, view points updated
old ent is cleared of client data and used as a death point, if killed feeds and explodes the rocket wherever it is, bringing view back to ht
if player survives for rocket timer, returns to previous ent copying old information back
> a new ent is formed at player's s.origin, which looks exactly like them. their model is changed and they lose control of all velocity (no strafing rockets), build timer becomes rocket live time, touch function = explosion, explosion = control restored, player moved back to old origins and the other ent is removed
~savvy
stalker can use +use bind to eat corpses that had armor:
 * 25% of original armor for class IF 10 or under armor
 * all armor if 10-50 armor was left, so that hts/grunts/sts/bios give all their armor, while mech doesn't give over max
~savvy
related to eating corpses, can eat gibs:
GIB_METALIC = armor
GIB_ORGANIC = health
therfore, mechs and xts give armor, rest give health?
>>>problem: other objects also might do "gibs", such as a misc_explobox exploding
~bloodsucker
for stalker or guardian, if mech/xt corpse is +use'd, then add spores / make more deadly if full
~savvy / bloodsucker
savvy:       spike spores do radius damage / larger radius with some particle effects and randomized spikes at any angle
bloodsucker: the explosion of the spike nade can explode frags, and frags spike nades
~bloodsucker
hatchling corpses / hatchies should have: damage = (velocity + mindamage);
MOD_DEADBUG = "<name> got a dead bug on their head"
~bloodsucker
turrets cannot shoot any alien if it behind an entity
~bloodsucker
increase health upgrade range
~savvy
MAKE SERVER ADMIN BE ABLE TO SET HIS/HER OWN VALUES FOR MOST DAMAGES, AMMO, AND GRENADES
~savvy close combat weapons
grunts:          knives - is side weapon
biotechs:        close range biogenetic spray (pepper spray) - is side weapon, can throw it away and use fists
shock trooopers: machete - is side weapon
heavy toopers:   mace / club - is side weapon
commandos:       sword - is side weapon
mechs:           stubby arms, do massive damage, used when out of ammo only
~savvy
if all eggs & healers or teleporters & depots are gone, then aliens or humans get the ability to upgrade anywhere
this would let people upgrade during sudden death as well
~savvy
mechs should be able to ramp their mechrocket power up, 1 by 1, this way they can control how many shots can be fired
grim's gloom takes 10 ammo per rocket out of mech's stash, problem with that is validation for the ramping, if you have enough left
also if you DO ramp it up, but LEAVE the ammo there while you control how many you are gonna toss out, then do you have the ability to shoot all your ammo twice, by getting many rockets ramped up while shooting your ammo away?
~savvy / kabelsax
wallwalking:
hatchlings get it by default - +use
breeders need a 1 frag upgrade for it: "Spikey Claws" - +use
grunts need 2 frag upgrade for it: "Gravity Boots" - +use
engineers need a 1 frag upgrade for it: "Artificial Gravity" +use
any other class uses +use bind already, except perhaps hts, but who wants wallwalking hts?
~ability to walk through alien structures as alien
good idea: no blocking by alien structures for aliens
bad idea: spikers could shoot aliens from inside, gasser gass would spawn inside aliens, aliens could no longer use obs stairs etc
~bloodsucker / savvy
bloodsucker: drone can "float", eg. jump starts grav ramping
        _-
      _-   \ <-- going this way
savvy:       drone can jump, have grav it does now, only travel faster, this way can still get up high, and even faster, and land quickly behind humans
             drone can jump using +moveup, but -moveup causes grav to be higher (faster drop) than normal grav
             drones in this way can attack by jumping over humans and releasing keys

~bloodsucker
guardian can do a "power lunge", it can basically crouch and fly forwards, ramp it longer held, place a cap though
~bloodsucker / savvy
stinger can press a key, and use a more enhanced damage or poisen attack
key possibilities: inventory, 'use special' command, etc
~bloodsucker / savvy
bloodsucker: stinger can have a special attack once per heal, eg. gets a special slash dmg once each time it heals from damage
savvy:       25% velocity reduction on whomever gets hit, if anyone, and 50% grav increase (HEAVIER)
~savvy
most aliens jump too high, it is impossible to attack when you overshoot humans all the time
the downside to increasing gravity is that you can't jump as high (DUH), so can't get to high spots easily
~a number of people, edo was one... some other people before i read edo's post on pg forums have suggested it
breeder (maybe upgraded) can pick up structures and move them
savvy: maybe it 'eats' it, so on death or same button/cmd can drop it, this can be interesting, having breeders eat spikers and running into human base. BEWARE OF EGGS - DISABLE WHILE IN MOTION? DISABLE CARRYING COMPLETELY?
~weston
hatchlings (upgrade) can resist exterminator laser <-- problems: 1-2 frag upgrade for 20 hp class...
~savvy
why do humans have medpacks while aliens do not?
idea: "biopacks" (use health works same with them, eg. it checks for health and determines correct one) for aliens
idea: humans cannot have or use medpacks, but medistation (like tremulous) can be @ base, or healer or something...
~savvy | SORT OF DONE
biotech upgrade "Battletech Pack"
gives more grenades
some more armor
a new grenade for the inventory which is a shrapbomb grenade (shoots some close-range shrap)
~savvy
grunt upgrade "Infared Scope"
give grunts infared vision of bought, via RDF_IRGOGGLES or whatever it is
~BuFFy
bouncing stalkers, like constant +moveup
~BuFFY | DONE
xts get claymores / bouncing bettys or something, some sort of land mine, instead of nades
~Kela
kamikaze breeders - need 10 frags for the upgrade, godmode for 20 seconds, when used, and the breeder explodes like 2 c4s
~savvy
shrapnel grenades - movetype_bounce, high grav though, so it resolves quickly, same model as flash nade
~savvy
kamis can shed their skin on first +use, second +use explodes them, so 1 right after the other results in double explosion
edit: leaves their armor behind as well
~savvy
tripwires do not detect more than 1 ent (no more for (;;) loop within mine.c's think function)
this way it stops at first ent, being more realistic
result: a mech can allow aliens past by standing in way of mine, engis can now get hit by aliens while mine jumping, without exploding mines
~inuyasha / savvy
inu:	custom crosshair for mechrockets, so that you can see where they will go
Savvy:	how about instead, a bunch of temp ent sparks that show where they will end up, each time a mechrocket is added, so spark, wait, spark, wait, release->fire
~savvy
make spikers shoot back when damaged, depending on if they are ready or not (this way, attackers can't kill it from across level without something happening)
~savvy
when hatchlings die with the "suicide spike" upgrade, or some other cool name, drops a spike spore
when grunts die with the martyrdom upgrade, they drop a frag grenade
~savvy / tachikoma
when an observer sends a special command, maybe hijack reload, they can see other observers and point at stuff using attack button
the observer then gets a TE_SPARK or something like that, where the sparks are randomly colored, at their origin point
the observer can see other observers in such a mode, along with their pointers (if they are using it)
~savvy
make an admin list for mutes, @addmute and @delmute
~savvy
human "teslas", you construct 1, then another, and so forth, A LIMIT ON HOW MANY
they should be able to target each other, to create electrical beams, in order of construction, or "links"
maybe their own edict_t *teslas; somewhere?
~savvy
alien "hives", hurts humans that get too close
~KeVVa / savvy
KeVVa: flying human class, as in like original flying quake2 classes
Savvy: bring back old grenade launcher class with a jetpack that can stay in air like in tremulous, and make sure that it can be brought down with damage
~savvy
humans' upwards and sideways velocities slow the closer they get to obstacles
~savvy
aliens and humans have a number of "upgrade" points that they can use
these new points can upgrade existing structures to be better, such as faster turrets, etc.
~savvy
"Inferno" - stinger fire upgrade
"Explosive Shell Pack" - shock trooper upgrade for reloading ex shells
~savvy / donut
spider web buildings for aliens, slows humans
~donut
breeders can cocoon / infest opponents

class concepts - place all new classes that are being made, all of their files, into a new .pak file
---
~savvy
healing alien class
~savvy
"Flamer" - human class with flame thrower - red fire, stingers become blue because they are "hotter"
~bloodsucker / savvy
bloodsucker: edit to "Flamer" - make cold trooper ("Sub-Zero"), is blue fire for cold to hurt aliens, while fire hurts humans
savvy:       slow aliens hit by fire 10% per hit - NOT DRONE SPIT, ONLY SLOW VELOCITY, NO SPEED DECREASE (like hitting a wall in your face)
~savvy / bloodsucker
savvy:       "Spikder" - a small alien that can fire spikes, +use discharges all spikes, if spikes hit teammates, teammates gain health for dmg value
bloodsucker: make proxy heal, like mobile healer, spikes give armor instead; spikes increase melee damage
bloodsucker:  <Bloodsucker> where bio=life || <Bloodsucker> mana=magic || <Bloodsucker> mangler?

Sudden Death Ideas - place ideas for sd here
---
~savvy
can upgrade during sd without healers / depots (maybe only 1 upgrade per person after sd start? <-- maybe a cvar or all upgrades as normal because people deserve to use their earned frags?)
~savvy
depots and healers do not die during sd start, allowed after sd start as normal
~savvy
healer / depot timers are reset at start of sd, for fast refreshes, then doubled for rest of sd after each use
~bloodsucker
everyone gets items + health + armor at start of sd, and healers / depots die as normal
~bloodsucker / savvy
bloodsucker:
% of hp + armor decreased over a set amount of time during SD without kills:
1% / 1 second
10% / 5 seconds
etc., until a kill or death
savvy:
movement based, use player trails to find campers
time based off of being hurt / hurting someone, use current health, not maximum health, so remains proportional
~savvy
idea: both humans and aliens run out of ammo (grenades and all, except for medpacks), so they must get up close and personal with their close combat weapons
edit: MAKE SURE DEPOTS AND HEALERS DO NOT RESTORE INVENTORY, ONLY MEDPACKS / HEALTH / ARMOR
      STINGER FIRE MUST NOT WORK, NOR XT GUN (both regen over time)
      WRAITH AND DRONE ACID / SPIT MUST NOT WORK (both regen over time)
      etc
~bloodsucker
breeder vs engi 1 hit kills

Gloom Changes
---

 ~~~ Gameplay aspects
[+] grunt guns not completely accurate
[+] 15 stinger fire with constant regen (except when using it)
[+] mech doomsday drops c4 instead of instagib attackers that finally take the fucker down
[ ] hatchling bounding boxes smaller
[ ] heavy trooper rocket launcher has no beep, but a constant particle effect marks the end of a 'laser' sight
[ ] commando clip size decreased to be the same as grunt
[ ] limited jetpack for exterminator, no more megajumps and power shield coverage
[ ] slower regeneration for exterminator cells
[+] class-based gravity system (already implemented i think, due to varying commando, drone, mech, stinger, and stalker jumps)
[+] drone spit affects exterminators with power shield enabled - via #defined option, to disable it

 ~~~ Classes (from Savvy only)
 ~ humans
[ ] 1 frag  - human flight class (Fly Boy)           - constant flight like wraith, and can also be taken down by damage, has a knife that works using a specialized human melee attack and a new handgun with red sparks on miss
[ ] 2 frags - human impact grenade class (Grenadier) - can fire impact grenades that cannot kill an egg easily. can also give out 1 grenade to a fellow human
[ ]   frag  -                                        - 
 ~ aliens
[ ] 1 frag  - alien healing class (Slimer)           - can heal aliens, and has a long slash range with special slime spit which hurts
[ ] 2 frags - alien spiker class (Needler)           - fires fast harmful spikes which regenerate
[ ]   frag  -                                        -
